## How to run the project

Setup your environment following the official [documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

Use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or change the commands below accordingly if you prefer to use [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/).


#### Packages and Libraries

Access the root directory and run the following command:

> yarn install

Check if there is a device or emulator connected using adb command:

> adb devices

#### React Native Command Line Interface

React Native has a built-in command-line interface. Rather than install and manage a specific version of the CLI globally, we recommend you access the current version at runtime using npx, which ships with Node.js. With npx react-native <command>, the current stable version of the CLI will be downloaded and executed at the time the command is run.

#### Running the application on Android

> npx react-native run-android

#### Running the application on iOS

> npx react-native run-ios



For further information, please access [React Native's documentation page](https://archive.reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started).


If you can't get this to work, see the [Troubleshooting page](https://reactnative.dev/docs/troubleshooting).
